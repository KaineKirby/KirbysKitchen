# KirbysKitchen
Recipe android application for CS372 course at WKU

This project was created within Android Studio.

Kirbyâ€™s Kitchen is a food and recipe application that provides users options for meals.
Utilizing the application users can choose to add recipes potentially from their favorite
restaurants, a family secret, or an all-time classic dish. Users, if they would rather 
find a restaurant that offers their favorite foods can utilize a map section of the application
which uses any location that they would like to use andlocates all nearby restaurants. 
Lastly, there is a section of the application where users can share their attempts to complete
a recipe by taking a photo of their creations. I think that this application is useful for
anyone who cooks or enjoys eating.
